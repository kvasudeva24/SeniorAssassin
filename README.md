# SeniorAssassin

The game senior assassin is a game played in my highschool by seniors. The objective of the game is that there a set amount of players, who each are hunted and have a target. 
When a player is eliminated, the person who got the elimination has the the person who he had elimanated's target. And, the target of the person who was elimanted is now being hunted by the person who got the original elimination.

Throught my experience with data structures last year, I realized that the game in its purest form, with no modifications is very similar to a doubly linked list. 
Each player is a node because they have a target, a hunter, and then other values such as phone number, so that they can get contacted when they need to know their next target. 

This is a project where I tried to learn JS and how it interacts w/ HTML and CSS. My progress will be updated in my commits.
